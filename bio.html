									Hi, my name is Jordy, AKA Summadat. I'm an audio engineering student, studying at SAE Institute in Perth, Western Australia</br></br>
									Music has always been a big part of my life, growing up playing guitar, and whatever other instrument I could get my hands on. Being a tinkerer of sorts, I also had a keen interest in the more technical "behind the scenes" aspects of audio.
									I got a taste for live performance playing guitar for No Thru Road, and drums for Grins 'n' Needles, and started DJing and producing electronic music around 2016</br></br>
									Some of the more notable moments in my artistic career include Never Mind the Ice, an inspiring community event organised by the members of Grins 'n' Needles, aimed at raising awareness of the growing drug problem in regional Australia.
									I've also had the luxury of DJing on the same lineups as some of my favourite artists, including Mr. Bill, Stickybuds, and Cheshire, and being sound and stage tech for some truly impressive shows, including Naughty By Nature, which featured an amazing live performance from Mr. Bill and his drummer, Hutch</br></br>
									These days, I am taking a keen interest in production and sound design for multimedia, especially games</br>(Check this space soon for some game related sample packs)</br></br>
									If there's anything you'd like to know about me or what I do, or you're interested in my services, please feel free to click the "Contact & Bookings" button below, or hit me up on Twitter or Soundcloud
